# Google Maps Practice

This is my practice project

- Work with Google Maps Javascript API in React

- Get data from a json file

- Responsive layout

- React Router for navigation

## React Google Maps API Docs

https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/#polyline

## Mobile view menu

- No scroll

- Just expand existing navbar. It would make more sense

## Here come the errors

InfoBox does not appear after navigating to Map and pressing the button

`InvalidValueError: setMap: not an instance of Map`

`mapRef.current is undefined`
