# Google Maps Practice

This is my practice project

- Work with Google Maps Javascript API in React

- Fecth data from the remote json file

- Responsive layout

- React Router for navigation

React library

https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/#polyline

Link to TRF website

## Next

1. Fetch() file

2. Use Object to clean up the code

Trail visibility

Just add text to Info display

Perhaps before element for each trail

3. UI White shadow for nav

Trail not clickable

- Change page title

- Set max / min zoom

## Fix

map() instead of for()

Check Marker Icons

`TypeError: can't access property "maps", window.google is undefined`

## React Router

Set up React Router
