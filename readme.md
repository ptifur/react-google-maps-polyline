# Google Maps Practice

This is my practice project

- Work with Google Maps Javascript API in React

- Fecth data from the remote json file

- Responsive layout

- React Router for navigation

React library

https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/#polyline

Link to TRF website

## Next

1. Fetch() file

2. Perhaps `before` element for each trail

3. UI White shadow for nav

## React Router

- Set up React Router

- Another page

Get images track profile from official site

Image from public or source?

## Split into components

- InfoBox with props

- Polyline

That's the point! One component, different props

## What else

Select active nav

Animation for the trail
