# Google Maps Practice

This is my practice project

- Work with Google Maps Javascript API in React

- Fecth data from the remote json file

- Responsive layout

- React Router for navigation

## React Google Maps API Docs

https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/#polyline

## Next

1. Fetch() file

2. In a separate component

## What else

- Get images track profile from official site

- favicon

Link from InfoBox to Trail description

## Here come the errors

InfoBox does not appear after navigating to Map and pressing the button

`InvalidValueError: setMap: not an instance of Map`

Because `onLoad` event does not fire?
